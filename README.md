## FAQ

### WTF is this?

Recently I was re-watching [My Boys (2006)](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/3965-my-boys). A great casual sitcom.

In episode 4x06, Hanger Management, Mike says he's claimed a lot of domain names and is willing to sell them to his friend Kenny. Among them he lists FaxYourBalls.com

As I understand it, normally networks need to register domain names when they mention them...however it would seem that, if they ever had it, they have since stopped paying for it.

So as a result, I've attempted to recreate the true spirit of FaxYourBalls.com

### Are my Balls actually being faxed?

No.

Nothing is ever uploaded anywhere.
This is a silly static site.

### I don't have any Balls. Can I still use this?

No, you must have balls to use FaxYourBalls.com

It actually is weird that you have no balls though.
Maybe you could find someone to fax you some?

### This only supports US style phone numbers, and I am not in the US. Why do you hate me?

That's a loaded question, and I'm not going to dignify that with a response.
